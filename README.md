# Cypress-Test-Suite

This project is a simple quiz application built with React and TypeScript, featuring Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) and component testing. The application allows users to take a quiz, answer questions, and view their score upon completion. Cypress is used to ensure the functionality of the application through automated tests.
